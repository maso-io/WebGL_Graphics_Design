### Spherical Object

Circle object of constant radius p(rho).<br>
Generated such that each vertex point has a random color<br>
With independent colors and vertex buffers.<br>
Next point of constant radius `p` is at an angle `dA += dA` away from the initial point `[p, 0]`<br>
The circle is then rotated an angle `PI/36` and then drawn again till it forms a complete revolution modelling a sphere.
