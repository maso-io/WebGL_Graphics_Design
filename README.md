#### Introduction to Computer Graphics Design

Explore different concept on rendering two- and three-dimensional graphics on
computer screens using open graphics language application programming interface.
The programs written will be computed directly on the graphics processing unit. HTML5 canvas is used to get a graphics programmable context whose user interface is written in JavaScript.
The vertex and fragment shaders that constitute the graphics program are written in a OpenGL Shader code.
