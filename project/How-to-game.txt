Stone Rush

How the game works:

1. Use the arrow keys or a,d,w,s to move in the left, right, up and down.
2. Progress from left-to-right and duck the rocks and level up.
3. The higher the level goes the more rocks are put into the game.

Functions:
Code contains two main objects:
1. Box object which makes up the "enemy" objects/rocks
2. Plane object which is controlled by the user to avoid collision with the rocks.

An "enemy" object has the following properties:
1. static values: velX and velY to control the velocity of the enemy in the x and y direction
2. static gameStatus: which tracks the current status of the game. whether its over or not
3. an ID which tracks the enemy ID 
4. draw method: which draws and textures the object
5. update method: which moves the object according to it's ID
6. source attribute with links to the object texutre

A Plane object
It is an extention of the Box/enemy object
The object contains:
1. static velX and velY to control the velocity of the plane in the xy plane
2. source attribute with links to the object texutre
3. update method: moves the object according to the controls of the user
4. collision detection method: checks if the plane has collided with any of the objects if it has its game over
